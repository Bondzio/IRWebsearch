<field name="content">Clara Löh home teaching (pre)prints talks cv \lambda sitemap Seminar: Gruppentheorie von Flächen, SS2013 Prof. Dr. C. L?h / M. Blank / S. Beier Aktuelles Es sind noch Plätze frei! Anmeldung per email an clara.loeh@mathematik.uni-r.de Die Vorbesprechung war am Freitag, den 1. Februar 2013, um 13:00 im Sitzungszimmer (M 201). Anmeldung: in der Vorbesprechung (oder per email). Aufbauend auf diesem Seminar können Themen für Abschlussarbeiten vergeben werden. Hinweise zu Abschlussarbeiten im Schwerpunkt Globale Analysis und Geometrie Die Vorlagen für Handouts/Ausarbeitungen sind online (s.u.); selbstverständlich können Sie Ihre Handouts/Ausarbeitungen auch anders erstellen/gestalten. Die Übersicht über die Vorträge ist online. Die Vortragseinteilung erfolgt voraussichtlich Mitte der letzten Vorlesungswoche. Seminar: Gruppentheorie von Flächen Das zentrale Thema der geometrischen Gruppentheorie ist es, den Zusammenhang zwischen geometrischen und gruppentheoretischen Eigenschaften von Gruppen zu untersuchen. Dabei werden häufig Mittel aus der algebraischen Topologie eingesetzt. In der Welt der Flächen sind solche Zusammenhänge besonders stark ausgeprägt und gut verstanden. In diesem Seminar werden wir uns mit topologischen, geometrischen und gruppentheoretischen Aspekten von Flächen beschäftigen. Insbesondere werden wir exemplarisch anhand von Flächen, ihrer Fundamentalgruppen und ihrer Abbildungsklassengruppen einige grundlegende Techniken der geometrischen Gruppentheorie kennenlernen. Details finden Sie in der ?bersicht ?ber alle Vortr?ge. Zeit und Ort Dienstag, 8--10, M 104 Material Die ?bersicht ?ber alle Vortr?ge (und einige Hinweise zum Ablauf des Seminars). LaTeX-Vorlage für Handouts: .tex, .pdf LaTeX-Vorlage für Ausarbeitungen: .tex, .pdf Hinweise zum Schreiben mathematischer Texte. Voraussetzungen Analysis I/II, Lineare Algebra I/II; Grundbegriffe der Gruppentheorie (wie aus den Grundvorlesungen); Fundamentalgruppe und Überlagerungstheorie (es genügt, die Algebraische Topologie I im SS 2013 zu hören); Kenntnisse aus Analysis IV sind hilfreich, aber nicht notwendig. Leistungsnachweis Notwendig f?r den Erwerb eines Leistungsnachweises sind: F?r einen unbenoteten Leistungsnachweis: Halten eines Seminarvortrags; regelmäßige und aktive Teilnahme am Seminar; ein Handout von ein bis zwei Seiten, das die wichtigsten Aspekte des Vortrags und ein paar Übungsaufgaben enthält; eine schriftliche Ausarbeitung des Vortrags (diese muss bis spätestens eine Woche vor dem Vortrag abgegeben werden).

Neben einer detaillierten Darstellung der theoretischen Grundlagen der verschiedenen Methoden liegt ein Schwerpunkt der Diskussion auf der Anwendung dieser Verfahren auf so unterschiedliche Systeme wie Festkörper, Oberflächen und Nanostrukturen bis hin zu Biomolekülen. Statt begleitender Übungen findet im Anschluss an die Vorlesung ein einwöchiges Computer-Praktikum statt, in dem die behandelten Methoden in praktischen Simulationen angewendet werden. Die Vorlesung wendet sich an Masterstudenten der Physik, bei geeigneten Vorkenntnissen auch an Studenten der Studiengänge B.Sc. Nanoscience und Computational Science. Aus dem Inhalt: Hartree-Fock * Dichtefunktionaltheorie (DFT) * Austauschkorrelationsfunktionale * DFT für periodische und endliche Systeme * Quanten-Molekulardynamik * Car-Parrinello-Dynamik * Geometrieoptimierung * Suche nach Übergangszuständen * Simulated annealing * Genetische Algorithmen * Simulation von IR-, Raman-, Photoelektron- und optischen Spektren SS 2013 Mathematische Methoden  Webseite des Kurses (eingeschränkter Zugang) Dieser Kurs vermittelt das notwendige mathematische Handwerkszeug für das Physikstudium und richtet sich insbesondere an Studenten des ersten Semesters in den Studiengängen B.Sc.

In der Woche vor dem eigentlichen Semesterbeginn findet ein Vorkurs Mathematik statt, der zur Auffrischung des Abiturwissens dient. Die Teilnahme wird empfohlen.

These microscopic devices have the same input/output characteristics as conventional mesoscopic diodes or transistors. Experimentally, they can be realized in break-junction measurements or with the help of Scanning Tunneling Microscopes. From the theoretical side, charge flow through single molecules is a genuine quantum mechanical problem and is usually studied within the formalism of non-equilibrium Greens-Function methodology. This course focusses mostly on the theoretical aspects of quantum transport and provides an introduction to density functional theory and the electronic structure of nanomaterials. Also the experimental realization of molecular devices will be part of the discussion. The target audience consists of Master students with a solid background in quantum mechanics and basic knowledge in condensed matter physics. Quantum field theory is not a necessary prerequisite. The course is also well suited for members of the Graduiertenkolleg 1570 "Electronic properties of Carbon based nanostructures". The lecture series will be followed by hands-on tutorials in the computer-lab, which cover the computation of various properties of nanomaterials (i.e. optimal geometry, band structure, vibrational properties) up to the simulation of I-V characteristics of realistic molecular devices with modern theoretical methods.

Prozedurale Elemente von C++, die von C abweichen Struktur, Ein- und Ausgabe, Typen, Anweisungen, Felder und Zeiger, Konstante, Sprachmischung, cast, Funktionen, Referenzen, default argumente, Überladung, Dynamischer Speicher, namespace, scope resolution 2. Objektorientierte Programmierung mit Klassen in C++ struct, union, class, this, Konstruktoren, Destruktoren, Operator-Funktionen, Konstante Objekte, friend, Ein- und Ausgabe, Statische member, constructor initializer list, Adressoperator, Referenuoperator, Zuweisungoperator 3. Vererbung in C++ Zugriffsschutz, initializer list, virtuelle Funktionen, rein virtuelle Funktionen, abstrakte Klassen, Mehrfachvererbung, virtuelle Basisklassen, typeid, dynamic cast 4. Generische Programmierung mit Templates template Funktionen, template Klassen 5. Exceptions 6. Die C++ Standard Library iostreams: Struktur, formatierte und unformatierte Übertragung, Text und Binärübertragung, Stromstatus, Dateien, Manipulatoren container und iteratoren: string: 7. Die Probleme und Nachteile von C++ C++ ist verbreitet und modern. Es hat jedoch neben Vorzügen auch eminente Konzeptschwächen und Entwurfsfehler. Auch diese werden selbstverständlich behandelt. (Aus Zeitmangel) nicht im Kurs behandelt Go Dir C++ Standard Library (kann nicht komplett behandelt werden) Voraussetzungen zum Kurs Go Bedienung des Rechners und elementare Betriebssystemkenntnisse (Windows) Elementare DOS-Kommandos (ja, die werden noch gebraucht, auch wenn Windows-fanouseks das partout nicht glauben wollen!) Programmierkenntnisse in C oder Java sind erforderlich Ablauf des Kurses Go Vorlesung (Theorie, Konkretisieren an Beispielen, Demonstrationen mit Beamer) Getrennte Übungen (Die Teilnehmer sollen den Stoff selbstständig erarbeiten und einüben) Übungsaufgaben werden gestellt Übungen auch betreut, Schwergewicht liegt jedoch auf selbständigem Arbeiten Gruppenarbeit erlaubt (ja sogar erwünscht, wenn sich kleine Gruppen bilden) Erstellen eines Projekts (vielleicht) Zielgruppe Go Studenten und Bedienstete mit Interesse am Programmieren in einer verbreiteten objektorientierten Sprache Verwendete Software Go Gnu C++ Leistungsnachweis Go Gelöste Übungsaufgaben Literatur Go Die Literaturangaben enthalten aus Platzgründen nur den/die Verfasser, den Titel, die ISBN und manchmal die Signatur.

<field name="content">Stand: 3. Juli 95 Der Text dieser Studienordnung ist nach dem aktuellen Stand sorgfältig erstellt; gleichwohl ist ein Irrtum nicht ausgeschlossen. Verbindlich ist der amtliche, beim Prüfungsamt einsehbare, im offiziellen Amtsblatt veröffentlichte Text. § 19 Kunstgeschichte Der vorliegende Paragraph der Magisterstudienordnung beschreibt Ziele, Inhalte und Verlauf des Studiums des Faches Kunstgeschichte im Rahmen des Magisterstudiengangs an der Universität Regensburg. Für eine Übersicht über den gesamten Studienaufbau sind auch die Allgemeinen Bestimmungen dieser Studienordnung sowie die Regelungen über das andere Fach oder die anderen Fächer der im Magisterstudium erforderlichen Fächerkombination zu Rate zu ziehen, die in anderen Paragraphen dieser Studienordnung gegeben sind. 1. Gegenstand des Faches Die Wissenschaft der Kunstgeschichte erforscht die Kunst des Abendlandes und jener Kulturbereiche, die sich für ihr Kunstschaffen, insbesondere im 20. Jahrhundert, westeuropäische Prinzipien zu eigen gemacht haben. Sie umfaßt den Zeitraum etwa von Konstantin dem Großen bis in die Gegenwart. Ihr Gegenstand sind sämtliche Gattungen visuell erfahrbarer Kunst: Architektur, Plastik, Malerei, Ornament, Kunstgewerbe, Photographie und verwandte Medien. Wesentliche Voraussetzungen für das Studium der Kunstgeschichte sind genaue Beobachtungsgabe, Fähigkeit zur Analyse und zur begrifflichen Formulierung anschaulicher Tatbestände, Erkenntnis- und Darstellungsvermögen in Bezug auf historische Zusammenhänge und Offenheit für die Inhalte anderer Geisteswissenschaften. Angesichts der Spannweite des Faches ist es unerläßlich, das Angebot des Lehrprogramms durch selbständiges Studium zu ergänzen und zu vertiefen. Im Vordergrund steht dabei die intensive Beschäftigung mit originalen Kunstwerken (Museen, Kirchen, Städte; Studienreisen im In- und Ausland). Wünschenswert ist ein eigener praktischer Umgang mit künstlerischen Techniken. Während des Studiums sollten die Möglichkeiten zu Praktika im künftigen Berufsfeld genützt werden. Die klassischen Berufsmöglichkeiten des Kunsthistorikers liegen in Museum und Denkmalpflege, seltener Hochschule. Hinzukommen Verlagswesen, Bibliothekstätigkeit, Journalismus, Kunsthandel, Erwachsenenbildung, Reiseführung (s. dazu W. Sauerländer: Kunsthistoriker. Blätter zur Berufskunde. Bd. 3, herausgegeben von der Bundesanstalt für Arbeit Nürnberg, Bielefeld, W. Bertelsmann Verlag). 2. Die Wahl der Fächer Das Studium der Kunstgeschichte wird durch das Studium von einem oder zwei anderen Fächern begleitet. Dabei bieten sich unter den an der Universität Regensburg vertretenen Fächern in erster Linie Disziplinen aus dem Gebiet der Geschichtswissenschaften, der Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaften, Klassische Archäologie, Volkskunde, Musikwissenschaft, Philosophie und Theologie an. Für die Wahl des zuletzt genannten Faches ist eine Ausnahmegenehmigung erforderlich; s. dazu § 7 der Magisterprüfungsordnung. Steht bereits zu Studienbeginn fest, daß das Studium zwischenzeitlich an einer anderen Universität fortgesetzt bzw. abgeschlossen werden soll, so wird dem Studenten dringend eine Dreifächerkombination empfohlen (Begründung: An den meisten deutschen Universitäten werden außer dem Hauptfach zwei Nebenfächer verlangt). 3. Studienbeginn Das Studium des Faches Kunstgeschichte kann zum Winter- oder zum Sommersemester begonnen werden. 4. Fachspezifische Studienvoraussetzungen Ist das Latinum nicht durch das Reifezeugnis belegt, so muß es bis zur Magisterprüfung nachgewiesen werden. Es kann in einem Kurs am Institut für klassische Philologie der Universität Regensburg (dort auch nähere Auskünfte) nachgeholt werden, vgl. § 5 dieser Studienordnung und den Anhang. Das Studium der Kunstgeschichte setzt neben Deutsch und Englisch zur Lektüre der Fachliteratur ausreichende Kenntnisse in den Sprachen Französisch und Italienisch voraus. Sie sollen, soweit nicht vorhanden, möglichst bald im Laufe des Studiums erworben werden. Zu den Begabungsvoraussetzungen s. o. Ziffer 1. 5. Ziele des Studiums Das Studium der Kunstgeschichte im Hauptfach soll gründliche Kenntnisse im Bereich der Denkmäler der verschiedenen Gattungen, Epochen und Kunstlandschaften Europas vermitteln, ferner der Quellen zur Kunstgeschichte und der wichtigen Fachliteratur einschließlich ihrer Theorien und Methoden. Das Studium des Faches im Nebenfach beschränkt sich auf eine Grundausbildung in diesem Fach und den Erwerb von Kenntnissen aus einem exemplarischen Schwerpunkt. 6. Inhalte des Studiums Das Fach gliedert sich in mittlere, neuere und neueste Kunstgeschichte. Es umfaßt die Gattungen Architektur, Malerei, Skulptur, angewandte Kunst und die neuen Kunstformen des 20. Jahrhunderts. Hinzukommt die Ikonographie nach religiösen, mythologischen und profanen Inhalten und ihren jeweiligen Gegenständen. Die Methoden richten sich nach den Fragestellungen. Sie reichen von der Analyse der Formen bis zur Auswertung schriftlicher Quellen, von der Stilgeschichte bis zur Ikonologie. Zum Studium gehört auch die Geschichte des Faches in seiner wissenschaftlichen Entwicklung. 7. Auslandsstudium Ein Auslandsstudium, das generell zu empfehlen ist, soll bis spätestens zum siebenten Fachsemester abgeleistet sein. Die Vorbereitungen dazu sollten deshalb noch vor der Zwischenprüfung in Angriff genommen werden. Es wird empfohlen, wegen der Integration der Auslandszeit in den Studienverlauf die Fachstudienberatung des Instituts zu konsultieren. 8. Aufbau des Studiums a) Lehrveranstaltungen Die festgelegten Anforderungen sind Mindestanforderungen. Sie bedürfen der stetigen Ergänzung durch eigene Anschauung und Lektüre sowie durch selbständiges Studium, zu dem die angebotenen Lehrveranstaltungen die Anregungen geben sollen. Lehrveranstaltungen werden in den Formen von Vorlesungen, Proseminaren, Hauptseminaren, Übungen und Exkursionen angeboten. Der Nachweis der erfolgreichen Teilnahme an einer Lehrveranstaltung kann durch eine Seminararbeit, ein Referat, eine Klausur oder eine mündliche Prüfung erworben werden; die Anforderungen legt der Dozent der Lehrveranstaltung zu Beginn fest. Lehrveranstaltungen können innerhalb der für die Ablegung der Prüfungen gesetzten Fristen wiederholt werden. b) Grundstudium Das Grundstudium umfaßt in der Regel vier Semester und wird mit der Zwischenprüfung abgeschlossen. Es vermittelt die folgenden Inhalte: Einführung in das Fach und seine Arbeitsmethoden; Schulung im kritischen Sehen von Kunstwerken; Vermittlung von Interpretationsgrundlagen und Einführung in wissenschaftliche Arbeitsweisen. Die Studenten müssen sich Denkmälerkenntnis und einen Überblick über den historischen Ablauf und die Epochen der Kunstgeschichte aneignen. c) Zwischenprüfung Die Zwischenprüfung kann abgelegt werden, sobald die Zulassungsvoraussetzungen erfüllt sind. Sie muß spätestens vor Beginn der Vorlesungszeit des siebten Fachsemesters abgelegt werden (s. § 2 Abs. 1 der Zwischenprüfungsordnung). Bei unzulässiger Überschreitung dieser vorgesehenen Studienzeit nach Maßgabe der Zwischenprüfungsordnung gilt sie als erstmals abgelegt und nicht bestanden. Die Zulassungs- und Prüfungsbestimmungen sind in § 37 der Zwischenprüfungsordnung geregelt, vgl. unten bei Ziffer 10. d) Hauptstudium Voraussetzung für den Eintritt in das Hauptstudium ist in der Regel die bestandene Zwischenprüfung im Fach Kunstgeschichte. Beim Studium des Faches als Nebenfach braucht keine Zwischenprüfung abgelegt zu werden, wenn sie im Hauptfach und dem anderen Nebenfach abgelegt worden ist. In diesem Falle ist Voraussetzung für den Zugang zum Hauptstudium, daß die Zulassungsvoraussetzungen für die Zwischenprüfung erfüllt sind, s. unten bei Ziffer 10. Im Hauptstudium soll der Student die im Grundstudium erworbenen Kenntnisse erweitern und schwerpunktmäßig vertiefen. Durch schriftlich abgefaßte Hauptseminarreferate soll er sich auf die selbständige wissenschaftliche Arbeit vorbereiten, die er in der Magisterarbeit und danach ggf. in der Dissertation zu leisten hat. e) Magisterprüfung Für die Bestellung der Prüfer hat der Kandidat ein Vorschlagsrecht. Ein Rechtsanspruch auf die Bestellung der vorgeschlagenen Prüfer besteht nicht. Für die Magisterarbeit kann der Kandidat im Rahmen der fachlichen Gegebenheiten Themenwünsche äußern. Wenn die Magisterarbeit im Fach Kunstgeschichte geschrieben wird, soll sie den Umfang von 80 Maschinenseiten (Text einschließlich Anmerkungen, den Abbildungsteil und die Bibliographie nicht mitgerechnet) nicht überschreiten. Im Gegensatz zur Dissertation, die einen wissenschaftlichen Fortschritt bringen muß, soll die Magisterarbeit lediglich zeigen, daß der Kandidat sich über ein Problem seines Hauptfaches ein selbständiges, wissenschaftlich begründetes Urteil erarbeiten und dieses klar entwickeln kann (§ 8 Abs. 2 Magisterprüfungsordnung). Der zeitliche Rahmen für die Erstellung der Magisterarbeit ist durch § 17 Abs. 4 der Magisterprüfungsordnung abgesteckt: er beträgt sechs Monate zwischen Ausgabe des Themas und Abgabe der Arbeit. f) Exkursionen (1) Im allgemeinen werden pro Semester vier bis fünf Tagesexkursionen angeboten, die in erster Linie für Studenten des Grundstudiums vorgesehen sind. Bei der Anmeldung zur Zwischenprüfung müssen 10 Exkursionstage nachgewiesen sein (s. u. Ziffer 10). Das Nachholen von zur Zwischenprüfung fehlenden Exkursionstagen ist grundsätzlich nicht möglich. (2) Die Teilnahme an mehrtägigen Semesterexkursionen (Hauptexkursionen) ist im allgemeinen erst nach erfolgreicher Ablegung der Zwischenprüfung möglich. Die speziellen Teilnahmebedingungen der mehrtägigen Semesterexkursionen werden von Fall zu Fall am Schwarzen Brett bekanntgegeben. 9. Tabellarische Übersicht Für ein ordnungsgemäßes Studium werden im Studium des Faches als Hauptfach insgesamt etwa 70 Semesterwochenstunden (SWS), im Nebenfachstudium höchstens 40 SWS veranschlagt. Im folgenden sind die vorgesehenen Lehrveranstaltungen für das Haupt- und das Nebenfachstudium tabellarisch zusammengestellt; Veranstaltungen, über deren erfolgreichen Besuch ein Nachweis erforderlich ist, sind gekennzeichnet. Fachsemester Fachgebiet Zahl der SWS Grundstudium (ggf. Erwerb sprachlicher Voraussetzungen) 1.

Aus den Vorlesungen und den besuchten Proseminaren werden die vier Veranstaltungen gewählt, die Gegenstand des mündlichen Teils der Zwischenprüfung sind (§ 37 Abs. 2 Nr. 2 b der Zwischenprüfungsordnung). 3) der Nachweis der erfolgreichen Teilnahme an den so bezeichneten Veranstaltungen ist Zulassungsvoraussetzung für die Magisterprüfung im ersten Hauptfach; die Zahl der erforderlichen Veranstaltungen ist im zweiten Hauptfach und im Nebenfach geringer, s. unten bei Ziffer 10. 10. Fachspezifische Zulassungsvoraussetzungen für die Prüfungen Im einzelnen sind folgende Leistungsnachweise als fachliche Zulassungsvoraussetzungen für die Zwischen- und Magisterprüfung bestimmt: Zwischenprüfung (§ 37 Zwischenprüfungsordnung) 1. Kunstgeschichte als Hauptfach: a) Nachweis der erfolgreichen Teilnahme am Einführungskurs in das Studium der Kunstgeschichte; b) Nachweis des erfolgreichen Besuches von vier mindestens zweistündigen Proseminaren; c) Besuch von mindestens vier Vorlesungen in Kunstgeschichte; d) Nachweis der erfolgreichen Exkursionsteilnahme in der Gesamtdauer von mindestens zehn Tagen. 2. Kunstgeschichte als Nebenfach: a) Nachweis der erfolgreichen Teilnahme am Einführungskurs in das Studium der Kunstgeschichte; b) Nachweis des erfolgreichen Besuches von einem mindestens zweistündigen Proseminar; c) Besuch von mindestens vier Vorlesungen in Kunstgeschichte; d) Nachweis der erfolgreichen Exkursionsteilnahme in der Gesamtdauer von mindestens fünf Tagen. Magisterprüfung (§ 38 Magisterprüfungsordnung) 1. Nachweis über die bestandene Zwischenprüfung im Fach Kunstgeschichte; dieser Nachweis entfällt, wenn Kunstgeschichte Nebenfach ist und die Zwischenprüfung im anderen Nebenfach abgelegt wurde; 2. Nachweis über die Kenntnis der lateinischen Sprache (Latinum), sofern nicht schon durch das Reifezeugnis nachgewiesen. Kandidaten, denen es aus von ihnen nicht zu vertretenden Gründen unmöglich war, die notwendigen Kenntnisse zu erwerben, können auf Antrag von dieser Voraussetzung entbunden werden; 3. Nachweis über die erfolgreiche Teilnahme an drei kunstgeschichtlichen Hauptseminaren, wenn Kunstgeschichte (erstes) Hauptfach ist, und zwei kunstgeschichtlichen Hauptseminaren, wenn sie zweites Hauptfach ist, und einem Hauptseminar, wenn sie Nebenfach ist; 4. Nachweis über die erfolgreiche Teilnahme an Exkursionen während des Hauptstudiums in der Gesamtdauer von mindestens 11 Tagen, wenn Kunstgeschichte (erstes oder zweites) Hauptfach ist, und fünf eintägigen Exkursionen im Hauptstudium, wenn sie Nebenfach ist.</field>

Das Studium der Kunstgeschichte setzt neben Deutsch und Englisch zur Lektüre der Fachliteratur ausreichende Kenntnisse in den Sprachen Französisch und Italienisch voraus. Sie sollen, soweit nicht vorhanden, möglichst bald im Laufe des Studiums erworben werden. Zu den Begabungsvoraussetzungen s. o. Ziffer 1. 5. Ziele des Studiums Das Studium der Kunstgeschichte im Hauptfach soll gründliche Kenntnisse im Bereich der Denkmäler der verschiedenen Gattungen, Epochen und Kunstlandschaften Europas vermitteln, ferner der Quellen zur Kunstgeschichte und der wichtigen Fachliteratur einschließlich ihrer Theorien und Methoden. Das Studium des Faches im Nebenfach beschränkt sich auf eine Grundausbildung in diesem Fach und den Erwerb von Kenntnissen aus einem exemplarischen Schwerpunkt. 6. Inhalte des Studiums Das Fach gliedert sich in mittlere, neuere und neueste Kunstgeschichte. Es umfaßt die Gattungen Architektur, Malerei, Skulptur, angewandte Kunst und die neuen Kunstformen des 20. Jahrhunderts. Hinzukommt die Ikonographie nach religiösen, mythologischen und profanen Inhalten und ihren jeweiligen Gegenständen. Die Methoden richten sich nach den Fragestellungen. Sie reichen von der Analyse der Formen bis zur Auswertung schriftlicher Quellen, von der Stilgeschichte bis zur Ikonologie. Zum Studium gehört auch die Geschichte des Faches in seiner wissenschaftlichen Entwicklung. 7. Auslandsstudium Ein Auslandsstudium, das generell zu empfehlen ist, soll bis spätestens zum siebenten Fachsemester abgeleistet sein. Die Vorbereitungen dazu sollten deshalb noch vor der Zwischenprüfung in Angriff genommen werden. Es wird empfohlen, wegen der Integration der Auslandszeit in den Studienverlauf die Fachstudienberatung des Instituts zu konsultieren. 8. Aufbau des Studiums a) Lehrveranstaltungen Die festgelegten Anforderungen sind Mindestanforderungen. Sie bedürfen der stetigen Ergänzung durch eigene Anschauung und Lektüre sowie durch selbständiges Studium, zu dem die angebotenen Lehrveranstaltungen die Anregungen geben sollen. Lehrveranstaltungen werden in den Formen von Vorlesungen, Proseminaren, Hauptseminaren, Übungen und Exkursionen angeboten. Der Nachweis der erfolgreichen Teilnahme an einer Lehrveranstaltung kann durch eine Seminararbeit, ein Referat, eine Klausur oder eine mündliche Prüfung erworben werden; die Anforderungen legt der Dozent der Lehrveranstaltung zu Beginn fest. Lehrveranstaltungen können innerhalb der für die Ablegung der Prüfungen gesetzten Fristen wiederholt werden. b) Grundstudium Das Grundstudium umfaßt in der Regel vier Semester und wird mit der Zwischenprüfung abgeschlossen. Es vermittelt die folgenden Inhalte: Einführung in das Fach und seine Arbeitsmethoden; Schulung im kritischen Sehen von Kunstwerken; Vermittlung von Interpretationsgrundlagen und Einführung in wissenschaftliche Arbeitsweisen. Die Studenten müssen sich Denkmälerkenntnis und einen Überblick über den historischen Ablauf und die Epochen der Kunstgeschichte aneignen. c) Zwischenprüfung Die Zwischenprüfung kann abgelegt werden, sobald die Zulassungsvoraussetzungen erfüllt sind. Sie muß spätestens vor Beginn der Vorlesungszeit des siebten Fachsemesters abgelegt werden (s. § 2 Abs. 1 der Zwischenprüfungsordnung). Bei unzulässiger Überschreitung dieser vorgesehenen Studienzeit nach Maßgabe der Zwischenprüfungsordnung gilt sie als erstmals abgelegt und nicht bestanden. Die Zulassungs- und Prüfungsbestimmungen sind in § 37 der Zwischenprüfungsordnung geregelt, vgl. unten bei Ziffer 10. d) Hauptstudium Voraussetzung für den Eintritt in das Hauptstudium ist in der Regel die bestandene Zwischenprüfung im Fach Kunstgeschichte. Beim Studium des Faches als Nebenfach braucht keine Zwischenprüfung abgelegt zu werden, wenn sie im Hauptfach und dem anderen Nebenfach abgelegt worden ist. In diesem Falle ist Voraussetzung für den Zugang zum Hauptstudium, daß die Zulassungsvoraussetzungen für die Zwischenprüfung erfüllt sind, s. unten bei Ziffer 10. Im Hauptstudium soll der Student die im Grundstudium erworbenen Kenntnisse erweitern und schwerpunktmäßig vertiefen. Durch schriftlich abgefaßte Hauptseminarreferate soll er sich auf die selbständige wissenschaftliche Arbeit vorbereiten, die er in der Magisterarbeit und danach ggf. in der Dissertation zu leisten hat. e) Magisterprüfung Für die Bestellung der Prüfer hat der Kandidat ein Vorschlagsrecht. Ein Rechtsanspruch auf die Bestellung der vorgeschlagenen Prüfer besteht nicht. Für die Magisterarbeit kann der Kandidat im Rahmen der fachlichen Gegebenheiten Themenwünsche äußern. Wenn die Magisterarbeit im Fach Kunstgeschichte geschrieben wird, soll sie den Umfang von 80 Maschinenseiten (Text einschließlich Anmerkungen, den Abbildungsteil und die Bibliographie nicht mitgerechnet) nicht überschreiten. Im Gegensatz zur Dissertation, die einen wissenschaftlichen Fortschritt bringen muß, soll die Magisterarbeit lediglich zeigen, daß der Kandidat sich über ein Problem seines Hauptfaches ein selbständiges, wissenschaftlich begründetes Urteil erarbeiten und dieses klar entwickeln kann (§ 8 Abs. 2 Magisterprüfungsordnung). Der zeitliche Rahmen für die Erstellung der Magisterarbeit ist durch § 17 Abs. 4 der Magisterprüfungsordnung abgesteckt: er beträgt sechs Monate zwischen Ausgabe des Themas und Abgabe der Arbeit. f) Exkursionen (1) Im allgemeinen werden pro Semester vier bis fünf Tagesexkursionen angeboten, die in erster Linie für Studenten des Grundstudiums vorgesehen sind. Bei der Anmeldung zur Zwischenprüfung müssen 10 Exkursionstage nachgewiesen sein (s. u. Ziffer 10). Das Nachholen von zur Zwischenprüfung fehlenden Exkursionstagen ist grundsätzlich nicht möglich. (2) Die Teilnahme an mehrtägigen Semesterexkursionen (Hauptexkursionen) ist im allgemeinen erst nach erfolgreicher Ablegung der Zwischenprüfung möglich. Die speziellen Teilnahmebedingungen der mehrtägigen Semesterexkursionen werden von Fall zu Fall am Schwarzen Brett bekanntgegeben. 9. Tabellarische Übersicht Für ein ordnungsgemäßes Studium werden im Studium des Faches als Hauptfach insgesamt etwa 70 Semesterwochenstunden (SWS), im Nebenfachstudium höchstens 40 SWS veranschlagt. Im folgenden sind die vorgesehenen Lehrveranstaltungen für das Haupt- und das Nebenfachstudium tabellarisch zusammengestellt; Veranstaltungen, über deren erfolgreichen Besuch ein Nachweis erforderlich ist, sind gekennzeichnet. Fachsemester Fachgebiet Zahl der SWS Grundstudium (ggf. Erwerb sprachlicher Voraussetzungen) 1.

<field name="content">Stand: 3. Juli 95 Der Text dieser Studienordnung ist nach dem aktuellen Stand sorgfältig erstellt; gleichwohl ist ein Irrtum nicht ausgeschlossen. Verbindlich ist der amtliche, beim Prüfungsamt einsehbare, im offiziellen Amtsblatt veröffentlichte Text. § 21 Musikwissenschaft Der vorliegende Paragraph der Magisterstudienordnung beschreibt Ziele, Inhalte und Verlauf des Studiums des Faches Musikwissenschaft im Rahmen des Magisterstudiengangs an der Universität Regensburg. Für eine Übersicht über den gesamten Studienaufbau sind auch die Allgemeinen Bestimmungen dieser Studienordnung sowie die Regelungen über das andere Fach oder die anderen Fächer der im Magisterstudium erforderlichen Fächerkombination zu Rate zu ziehen, die in anderen Paragraphen dieser Studienordnung gegeben sind. 1. Berührungspunkte mit anderen Studiengängen Das hier behandelte Studienfach Musikwissenschaft hat inhaltliche Berührungspunkte mit dem Studium der Musikerziehung mit dem Ziel des Abschlusses durch das Staatsexamen für eines der Lehrämter, s.u. bei Ziffer 4. Entsprechende Studienleistungen werden anerkannt, vgl. § 4 dieser Studienordnung. 2. Studienbeginn Das Studium der Musikwissenschaft kann zum Winter- oder Sommersemester aufgenommen werden. 3. Fachspezifische Studienvoraussetzungen Eine Eignungsprüfung ist nicht vorgeschrieben. Grundkenntnisse in Musiktheorie und Klavierspiel erleichtern aber das Studium wesentlich. Für den Umgang mit historischen Quellen und aktueller Forschungsliteratur sind Kenntnisse der englischen, französischen, italienischen und lateinischen Sprache von erheblicher Bedeutung. Wer keine ausreichenden Kenntnisse von seiner Gymnasialzeit her mitbringt, sollte von der Möglichkeit Gebrauch machen, die entsprechenden Sprachkurse an der Universität zu besuchen. Das Latinum muß für die Zulassung zur Magisterprüfung im (ersten) Hauptfach Musikwissenschaft nachgewiesen werden, s. § 5 dieser Studienordnung und den Anhang. 4. Ziele und Inhalte des Studiums Das Magisterstudium der Musikwissenschaft soll einen Überblick über die abendländische Musikgeschichte sowie Vertrautheit mit der historischen Terminologie des Faches und mit dem Standardrepertoire vermitteln. Zugleich soll es in die spezifischen Techniken und Methoden der Musikwissenschaft einführen und zu einem kritischen Urteil über Fragen des Faches und der musikwissenschaftlichen Forschung befähigen. Alles Wissen um die Musik und alle historischen, geisteswissenschaftlichen wie auch theoretischen Fragen an die Musik gehören zur Musikwissenschaft. Sie gehört zu den Geisteswissenschaften, also zu den Fächern, die sich mit den geistigen und künstlerischen Leistungen der Menschen in Wechselwirkung zur Gesellschaft ihrer Zeit befassen. Aus organisatorischen Gründen wird die Musikwissenschaft gewöhnlich in drei Bereiche aufgegliedert: die sog. historische, die sog. systematische Musikwissenschaft und die Musikethnologie. Die Aufteilung ist jedoch insofern als eher künstlich zu betrachten, als alle Teildisziplinen zum Verständnis der Musik als menschliche Schöpfung beitragen können. Zur historischen Musikwissenschaft gehört die historisch interpretierende Auseinandersetzung mit der Musik sowie die Klärung und Darstellung musikgeschichtlicher Vorgänge und Zusammenhänge. Dabei geht es nicht nur um die im engeren Sinne "fachlichen" Fragen von Kompositionslehre, -technik und -geschichte bzw. musikalische Terminologie oder um die Biographie, sondern auch um historisch wandelbare Konzeptionen der Musik und ihre Stellung in der übergreifenden Geschichte der Ideen. Dazu kommen die manchmal als "philologisch" bezeichneten Forschungsbereiche wie Notations- und Quellenkunde, die Bibliographie und die Erforschung der Voraussetzungen, unter denen jeweils musiziert wurde: Traditionen, Institutionen, Instrumentenkunde, Aufführungspraxis, auch Ikonographie. Unter der Bezeichnung systematische Musikwissenschaft werden demgegenüber Akustik, Musikphysiologie, Musiksoziologie, Teilbereiche der Musiktheorie und Musikästhetik zusammengefaßt. Eine genaue Abgrenzung zur historischen Musikwissenschaft ist vor allem bei der historisch orientierten Musiktheorie, -philosophie und -ästhetik freilich weder möglich noch sinnvoll. Der dritte Bereich, die musikalische Volks- und Völkerkunde, wird als Musikethnologie bezeichnet. Den Schwerpunkt in Forschung und Lehre bildet am Institut für Musikwissenschaft der Universität Regensburg die historische Musikwissenschaft. Vom Fach Musikwissenschaft ist an der Universität Regensburg das Fach Musikerziehung zu unterscheiden, das im Rahmen der Studiengänge für Lehramt an Grund-, Haupt- oder Realschulen im Gegensatz zum Magisterstudiengang Musikwissenschaft mit dem Staatsexamen abgeschlossen wird. Das Studium des Faches Musikerziehung umfaßt instrumentale und vokale Ausbildung, Gehörbildung, Musikgeschichte und fachdidaktische Bereiche. 5. Studienberatung Das Institut bestimmt eine Lehrperson, die die Aufgaben der Studienberatung wahrnimmt. 6. Auslandsstudium Austauschprogramme der Universität ermöglichen Studenten und Studentinnen, für ein Semester bzw. ein Jahr ins Ausland zu gehen, um Studien in einer dortigen Universität zu treiben, die als Äquivalent zu den hiesigen angerechnet werden können. Ein evtl. Austausch ist jeweils mit den Dozenten des Instituts zu besprechen und kann erst nach der Zwischenprüfung unternommen werden. 7. Studienaufbau 7.1 Gliederung des Studiums Das Studium ist in zwei Abschnitte gegliedert: das Grundstudium, das in der Regel vier Semester dauert und mit der Zwischenprüfung abgeschlossen wird, und das Hauptstudium. Das Grundstudium dient der Orientierung, der Einführung in die musiktheoretische Grundlagen (propädeutische Übungen), führt in die Sachgebiete und Methoden der Musikwissenschaft ein und soll die Fähigkeit zu selbständigem Arbeiten entwickeln. Das Hauptstudium dient der Vertiefung und Erweiterung des Fachwissens sowie der Entwicklung der Fähigkeit zu selbständigem wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten. Die Zulassungsvoraussetzungen für die Zwischenprüfung und Magisterprüfung im Fach Musikwissenschaft sind unter Ziffer 9 aufgeführt. Beim Studium des Faches als Nebenfach braucht keine Zwischenprüfung abgelegt zu werden, wenn sie im Hauptfach und dem anderen Nebenfach abgelegt worden ist. In diesem Falle ist Voraussetzung für den Zugang zum Hauptstudium, daß die Zulassungsvoraussetzungen für die Zwischenprüfung erfüllt sind (s. unten bei Ziffer 9). 7.2 Lehrveranstaltungen In den Lehrveranstaltungen werden sowohl Überblicksveranstaltungen als auch Spezialveranstaltungen angeboten, beispielsweise zu musikgeschichtlichen Epochen, zu spezifischen Repertoires nach Regionen sowie zu den Beziehungen der Stile und Repertoires untereinander, zu bedeutenden Quellen sowie zu Arten und Problemen musikalischer Überlieferung, zur Geschichte von Kompositionstechniken und kompositorischen Gestaltungsprinzipien, zu spezifischen musikalischen Gattungen, zum Schaffen einzelner Komponisten oder zu speziellen Werken bzw. Werkgruppen. Die Notationskunde, das Studium von historischen Notationen, gehört zum Hauptstudium. Die Paläographie der Musik ermöglicht den Zugang zu den Quellen und zur Überlieferung sowie zum jeweiligen Kompositionsstil und deren technischen Grundlagen. In den Vorlesungen (V) werden enger oder weiter gefaßte Themen der Musikgeschichte behandelt. Die Übungen (Ü) dienen vorwiegend der Erarbeitung des handwerklichen Rüstzeugs der Musikwissenschaft und zur Repetition von Prüfungsstoff (insbesondere aus den musikpraktischen und -theoretischen Übungen des Grundstudiums). Grundlage der Proseminare (PS) und Hauptseminare (HS) ist die aktive Mitarbeit der Teilnehmer. In eigenen Beiträgen soll die methodische und kritische Auseinandersetzung mit musikwissenschaftlichen Fragestellungen erarbeitet werden. Unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen kann an einem Hauptseminar, das dann als Proseminar gilt, auch während des Grundstudiums teilgenommen werden. Die Veranstaltungen können im Rahmen der für die Meldung zu den Prüfungen gesetzten Fristen wiederholt werden. Exkursionen finden in regelmäßigem Turnus statt, u. a. zu Fachkongressen und Bibliotheken bzw. Museen. 7.3 Vorbereitung und Durchführung der Prüfungen Die Magisterarbeit soll, wenn sie in Musikwissenschaft geschrieben wird, den Umfang von 80 Seiten nicht überschreiten. Das Thema wird vom Prüfer gestellt und vom Prüfungsausschuß ausgegeben. Die Bearbeitungszeit ist sechs Monate; Näheres ist in § 17 der Magisterprüfungsordnung geregelt. Um sich für die schriftliche und mündliche Prüfung vorzubereiten, empfiehlt es sich, über einen längeren Zeitraum in Kontakt mit dem Prüfenden zu bleiben, auch um eventuelle Schwerpunktthemen festzulegen. Den Inhalt der Zwischenprüfung bilden neben Spezialfragen zu drei (bei Musikwissenschaft als Nebenfach: zwei) besuchten Lehrveranstaltungen vor allem Fragen zu Bibliographie, Terminologie, musikalischer Allgemeinbildung und die Kommentierung von Klang- und Notenbeispielen. Ein allgemeiner Überblick über die Musikgeschichte wird erwartet. In der Magisterprüfung wird ein Gesamtüberblick über die Musikgeschichte, vor allem über die Thematik der angebotenen Lehrveranstaltungen, und Vertrautheit mit der historischen Terminologie sowie mit den Methoden des Faches und mit dem Standardrepertoire erwartet. 8. Tabellarische Übersicht Für ein ordnungsgemäßes Studium werden höchstens 80 Semesterwochenstunden (SWS) im Hauptfachstudium und 40 SWS im Nebenfachstudium veranschlagt; davon entfallen jeweils etwa 10 % auf das Studium freier Wahl (§ 3 Abs. 2 Magisterprüfungsordnung). In den folgenden Übersichten werden diejenigen Lehrveranstaltungen mit der jeweiligen Semesterwochenstundenzahl genannt, deren Besuch im Regelfall vorgesehen ist.

Verbindlich ist der amtliche, beim Prüfungsamt einsehbare, im offiziellen Amtsblatt veröffentlichte Text. ANHANG Sprachkenntnisse und deren Nachweis Als Zulassungsvoraussetzungen zur Zwischen- oder Magisterprüfung werden in vielen Fächern Fremdsprachenkenntnisse gefordert. Der Nachweis wird in der Regel durch Schulzeugnisse geführt. Die folgende Zusammenstellung gibt gängige Möglichkeiten an, den Nachweis für die verschiedenen Stufen solcher Kenntnisse zu führen, soweit die Prüfungsordnungen nichts Näheres bestimmen. Der jeweils höhere Nachweis schließt die niedrigeren Nachweise ein. Weitere Möglichkeiten sind in einem Merkblatt "Nachweis der nach der Lehramtsprüfungsordnung I vorgeschriebenen Fremdsprachenkenntnisse" in der jeweils geltenden Fassung angegeben, das beim Prüfungssekretariat erhältlich ist. Es wird darauf hingewiesen, daß die hier genannten Möglichkeiten nur für den Zweck der Zulassung zu den genannten Prüfungen der Universität Regensburg gültig sind. Verbindlich für die Zulassung zur Ersten Staatsprüfung für ein Lehramt dagegen sind die in dem o.a. Merkblatt wiedergegebenen Bestimmungen. I: oberste Stufe: sichere Kenntnis, sichere Kenntnisse, gesicherte Kenntnisse oder ähnliches; oder konkrete Bezeichnung des Nachweises wie "Latinum", "Graecum": a) Latinum Das Latinum wird durch einen entsprechenden Vermerk im Zeugnis der allgemeinen Hochschulreife nachgewiesen. Nachweise aus einem anderen Land der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, in dem verschiedene Stufen des Latinums erworben werden können, gelten nur, wenn das Große Latinum nachgewiesen wird. Das Latinum kann nachträglich durch eine Ergänzungsprüfung in Latein an einem Gymnasium erworben werden. Die Universität bietet zu jedem Wintersemester einen Vorbereitungskurs auf diese Prüfung an; Auskunft gibt das Institut für Klassische Philologie. b) Graecum Das Graecum wird durch einen entsprechenden Vermerk im Zeugnis der allgemeinen Hochschulreife nachgewiesen. Das Graecum kann nachträglich durch eine Ergänzungsprüfung in Griechisch an einem Gymnasium erworben werden. Die Universität bietet zu jedem Wintersemester einen Vorbereitungskurs auf diese Prüfung an; Auskunft gibt das Institut für Klassische Philologie. c) Gesicherte Kenntnisse in anderen Fremdsprachen Der Nachweis kann geführt werden durch: - das Zeugnis der allgemeinen Hochschulreife mit mindestens der Note "ausreichend" in einer fortgeführten Fremdsprache (d.h. in der ersten, zweiten oder dritten Fremdsprache des Gymnasiums oder in einer Fremdsprache auf entsprechendem Niveau einer anderen zur allgemeinen Hochschulreife führenden Schulart) oder - ein Jahreszeugnis eines öffentlichen oder staatlich anerkannten Gymnasiums mit mindestens der Note "ausreichend" nach fünf aufsteigenden Jahren Pflichtunterricht in der ersten Fremdsprache oder nach drei aufsteigenden Jahren Pflichtunterricht in der zweiten oder dritten Fremdsprache. Nachträglich können solche Kenntnisse an der Universität Regensburg durch Teilnahme an der "Studienbegleitenden Fremdsprachenausbildung" erworben werden; der Nachweis wird geführt durch das Abschlußzertifikat der allgemeinen Sprachausbildung, Stufe II (Kursniveau V). Die Gültigkeit eines solchen Nachweises ist jedoch auf die oben genannten Prüfungen der Universität Regensburg beschränkt. II: mittlere Stufe: Kenntnis, Kenntnisse einer Fremdsprache a) Lateinkenntnisse Lateinkenntnisse können nachgewiesen werden - durch das Zeugnis der allgemeinen Hochschulreife mit mindestens der Note "ausreichend" in Latein, oder - durch das Kleine Latinum (eines anderen Landes der Bundesrepublik Deutschland), oder - durch das Jahreszeugnis eines öffentlichen oder staatlich anerkannten Gymnasiums mit mindestens der Note "ausreichend" nach drei aufsteigenden Jahren Pflichtunterricht in der ersten Fremdsprache oder nach zwei aufsteigenden Jahren Pflichtunterricht in der zweiten oder dritten Fremdsprache im Fach Latein. Der Nachweis kann auch durch das Bestehen einer entsprechenden Prüfung am Staatsinstitut für die Ausbildung von Lehrern an Realschulen erworben werden. Der Nachweis kann auch durch das Bestehen einer entsprechenden Prüfung bei der Theologischen Fakultät einer bayerischen Universität erworben werden; die Katholisch-Theologische Fakultät der Universität Regensburg bietet jedoch keine solche Prüfung an. Für die Fächer des Magisterstudiengangs der Universität Regensburg, die einen solchen Nachweis speziell für Latein als Zulassungsvoraussetzung zu einer der Prüfungen fordern (Deutsche Philologie und Englische Philologie), kann diese Forderung auch durch eine Bestätigung des Instituts für Klassische Philologie darüber, daß die Teilnahme am zweiten Ausbildungsabschnitt des Sprachkurses zur Vorbereitung auf die staatliche Lateinprüfung empfohlen wird, erfüllt werden. Zum Erwerb der Kenntnisse kann der Lateinunterricht des Instituts für Klassische Philologie dienen. Allerdings ist die Gültigkeit eines solchen Nachweises auf die genannten Magisterfächer der Universität Regensburg beschränkt. Es ist daher sehr viel empfehlenswerter, die staatliche Prüfung für das Latinum abzulegen. b) Kenntnisse in anderen Fremdsprachen Kenntnisse in anderen Fremdsprachen können nachgewiesen werden: - durch das Zeugnis der allgemeinen Hochschulreife mit mindestens der Note "ausreichend" in einer Fremdsprache, oder - durch das Jahreszeugnis eines öffentlichen oder staatlich anerkannten Gymnasiums mit mindestens der Note "ausreichend" nach drei aufsteigenden Jahren Pflichtunterricht in der ersten Fremdsprache oder nach zwei aufsteigenden Jahren Pflichtunterricht in der zweiten oder dritten Fremdsprache. III: unterste Stufe: Grundkenntnisse in einer Fremdsprache Grundkenntnisse in einer Fremdsprache können durch eine Bestätigung über die erfolgreiche Teilnahme am Grundstufenunterricht der Allgemeinen Fremdsprachenausbildung der Universität Regensburg im Umfang von vier Semesterwochenstunden (Kursniveau II) nachgewiesen werden. Auch hier ist die Gültigkeit des Nachweises beschränkt auf den o.a. Zweck der Zulassung zur Zwischen- oder Magisterprüfung der Universität Regensburg.

<field name="important">Stand: 3. Juli 95 Der Text dieser Studienordnung ist nach dem aktuellen Stand sorgfältig erstellt; gleichwohl ist ein Irrtum nicht ausgeschlossen. Verbindlich ist der amtliche, beim Prüfungsamt einsehbare, im offiziellen Amtsblatt veröffentlichte Text. ANHANG Sprachkenntnisse und deren Nachweis Als Zulassungsvoraussetzungen zur Zwischen- oder Magisterprüfung werden in vielen Fächern Fremdsprachenkenntnisse gefordert. Der Nachweis wird in der Regel durch Schulzeugnisse geführt. Die folgende Zusammenstellung gibt gängige Möglichkeiten an, den Nachweis für die verschiedenen Stufen solcher Kenntnisse zu führen, soweit die Prüfungsordnungen nichts Näheres bestimmen. Der jeweils höhere Nachweis schließt die niedrigeren Nachweise ein. Weitere Möglichkeiten sind in einem Merkblatt "Nachweis der nach der Lehramtsprüfungsordnung I vorgeschriebenen Fremdsprachenkenntnisse" in der jeweils geltenden Fassung angegeben, das beim Prüfungssekretariat erhältlich ist. Es wird darauf hingewiesen, daß die hier genannten Möglichkeiten nur für den Zweck der Zulassung zu den genannten Prüfungen der Universität Regensburg gültig sind. Verbindlich für die Zulassung zur Ersten Staatsprüfung für ein Lehramt dagegen sind die in dem o.a. Merkblatt wiedergegebenen Bestimmungen. I: oberste Stufe: sichere Kenntnis, sichere Kenntnisse, gesicherte Kenntnisse oder ähnliches; oder konkrete Bezeichnung des Nachweises wie "Latinum", "Graecum": a) Latinum Das Latinum wird durch einen entsprechenden Vermerk im Zeugnis der allgemeinen Hochschulreife nachgewiesen. Nachweise aus einem anderen Land der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, in dem verschiedene Stufen des Latinums erworben werden können, gelten nur, wenn das Große Latinum nachgewiesen wird. Das Latinum kann nachträglich durch eine Ergänzungsprüfung in Latein an einem Gymnasium erworben werden. Die Universität bietet zu jedem Wintersemester einen Vorbereitungskurs auf diese Prüfung an; Auskunft gibt das Institut für Klassische Philologie. b) Graecum Das Graecum wird durch einen entsprechenden Vermerk im Zeugnis der allgemeinen Hochschulreife nachgewiesen. Das Graecum kann nachträglich durch eine Ergänzungsprüfung in Griechisch an einem Gymnasium erworben werden. Die Universität bietet zu jedem Wintersemester einen Vorbereitungskurs auf diese Prüfung an; Auskunft gibt das Institut für Klassische Philologie. c) Gesicherte Kenntnisse in anderen Fremdsprachen Der Nachweis kann geführt werden durch: - das Zeugnis der allgemeinen Hochschulreife mit mindestens der Note "ausreichend" in einer fortgeführten Fremdsprache (d.h. in der ersten, zweiten oder dritten Fremdsprache des Gymnasiums oder in einer Fremdsprache auf entsprechendem Niveau einer anderen zur allgemeinen Hochschulreife führenden Schulart) oder - ein Jahreszeugnis eines öffentlichen oder staatlich anerkannten Gymnasiums mit mindestens der Note "ausreichend" nach fünf aufsteigenden Jahren Pflichtunterricht in der ersten Fremdsprache oder nach drei aufsteigenden Jahren Pflichtunterricht in der zweiten oder dritten Fremdsprache.

Studien- und Pr?fungsinhalte und das Pr?fungsverfahren in den Nebenf?chern Volkswirtschaftslehre, Betriebswirtschaftslehre, Wirtschaftsinformatik und Naturwissenschaftliche Informatik sind in eigenen Pr?fungsordnungen f?r das Nebenfachstudium geregelt. In anderen Nebenf?chern werden die Pr?fungen durch Vereinbarungen zwischen den beteiligten Pr?fungs?mtern geregelt. (5) Die m?ndlichen Pr?fungen gem?? Abs. 2 bis Abs. 4 sind nach Abgabe der Diplomarbeit und in einem Zeitraum von vier Wochen am Ende des neunten Fachsemesters (Regelpr?fungstermin) abzulegen. Die Pr?fung im Nebenfach kann vorgezogen werden; der Kandidat hat dazu einen separaten Zulassungsantrag zu stellen und die Leistungsnachweise gem?? ? 24 Abs. 1 Nr. 4 Buchst. b zu erbringen. Eine der Pr?fungen Mathematik I oder Mathematik II kann vorgezogen werden. ? 5a und ? 31 Abs. 2 bleiben unber?hrt. (6) Den drei Pr?fungsf?chern Mathematik I - III ist ein Stoffumfang zugrunde zu legen, der je zw?lf Semesterwochenstunden an Lehrveranstaltungen des Hauptstudiums entspricht. Elementare Grundkenntnisse in Algebra und Topologie werden vorausgesetzt und nicht auf diesen Stoffumfang angerechnet. Der Nebenfachpr?fung ist ein Stoffumfang zugrunde zu legen, der etwa zehn bis zw?lf Semesterwochenstunden an Lehrveranstaltungen des jeweiligen Diplomstudienganges entspricht. (7) Die drei m?ndlichen Pr?fungen in Mathematik m?ssen bei jeweils verschiedenen Pr?fern abgelegt werden. ? 27 Diplomarbeit (1) In der Diplomarbeit soll der Kandidat zeigen, da? er sein Fach in angemessener Weise beherrscht und in der Lage ist, nach wissenschaftlichen Grunds?tzen selbst?ndig zu arbeiten. (2) Die Diplomarbeit darf in Ausnahmef?llen mit Zustimmung des Pr?fungsausschusses au?erhalb der Fakult?t ausgef?hrt werden, sofern eine pr?fungsberechtigte Person bei der Vergabe der Arbeit schriftlich ihr Einverst?ndnis erkl?rt, das Erstgutachten gem?? Absatz 8 zu ?bernehmen. (3) Eine Ausgabe des Themas der Diplomarbeit vor Zulassung des Kandidaten zur Diplompr?fung bedeutet keine Entscheidung ?ber die Pr?fungszulassung. (4) Die Ausgabe des Themas der Diplomarbeit erfolgt durch einen Pr?fungsberechtigten ?ber den Vorsitzenden des Pr?fungsausschusses. Der Ausgabetag ist aktenkundig zu machen. Auf Antrag des Kandidaten sorgt der Vorsitzende daf?r, da? er in angemessener Zeit das Thema f?r eine Diplomarbeit erh?lt.

In anderen Nebenf?chern werden die Pr?fungen durch Vereinbarungen zwischen den beteiligten Pr?fungs?mtern geregelt. (5) Die m?ndlichen Pr?fungen gem?? Abs. 2 bis Abs. 4 sind nach Abgabe der Diplomarbeit und in einem Zeitraum von vier Wochen am Ende des neunten Fachsemesters (Regelpr?fungstermin) abzulegen. Die Pr?fung im Nebenfach kann vorgezogen werden; der Kandidat hat dazu einen separaten Zulassungsantrag zu stellen und die Leistungsnachweise gem?? ? 24 Abs. 1 Nr. 4 Buchst. b zu erbringen. Eine der Pr?fungen Mathematik I oder Mathematik II kann vorgezogen werden. ? 5a und ? 31 Abs. 2 bleiben unber?hrt. (6) Den drei Pr?fungsf?chern Mathematik I - III ist ein Stoffumfang zugrunde zu legen, der je zw?lf Semesterwochenstunden an Lehrveranstaltungen des Hauptstudiums entspricht. Elementare Grundkenntnisse in Algebra und Topologie werden vorausgesetzt und nicht auf diesen Stoffumfang angerechnet. Der Nebenfachpr?fung ist ein Stoffumfang zugrunde zu legen, der etwa zehn bis zw?lf Semesterwochenstunden an Lehrveranstaltungen des jeweiligen Diplomstudienganges entspricht. (7) Die drei m?ndlichen Pr?fungen in Mathematik m?ssen bei jeweils verschiedenen Pr?fern abgelegt werden. ? 27 Diplomarbeit (1) In der Diplomarbeit soll der Kandidat zeigen, da? er sein Fach in angemessener Weise beherrscht und in der Lage ist, nach wissenschaftlichen Grunds?tzen selbst?ndig zu arbeiten. (2) Die Diplomarbeit darf in Ausnahmef?llen mit Zustimmung des Pr?fungsausschusses au?erhalb der Fakult?t ausgef?hrt werden, sofern eine pr?fungsberechtigte Person bei der Vergabe der Arbeit schriftlich ihr Einverst?ndnis erkl?rt, das Erstgutachten gem?? Absatz 8 zu ?bernehmen. (3) Eine Ausgabe des Themas der Diplomarbeit vor Zulassung des Kandidaten zur Diplompr?fung bedeutet keine Entscheidung ?ber die Pr?fungszulassung. (4) Die Ausgabe des Themas der Diplomarbeit erfolgt durch einen Pr?fungsberechtigten ?ber den Vorsitzenden des Pr?fungsausschusses. Der Ausgabetag ist aktenkundig zu machen. Auf Antrag des Kandidaten sorgt der Vorsitzende daf?r, da? er in angemessener Zeit das Thema f?r eine Diplomarbeit erh?lt. (5) Das Thema kann nur einmal und nur aus triftigen Gr?nden und mit Einwilligung des Vorsitzenden des Pr?fungsausschusses innerhalb des ersten Drittels der Bearbeitungszeit zur?ckgegeben werden. (6) Die Zeit von der Themenstellung bis zur Ablieferung der Diplomarbeit soll sechs Monate nicht ?berschreiten. Auf begr?ndeten Antrag des Kandidaten kann die Bearbeitungszeit ausnahmsweise bis zu sechs Monaten verl?ngert werden. Weist der Kandidat durch ?rztliches Zeugnis nach, da? er durch Krankheit an der Bearbeitung gehindert ist, ruht die Bearbeitungszeit. (7) Die Diplomarbeit ist in drei Exemplaren fristgem?? an den Vorsitzenden des Pr?fungsausschusses zu liefern; der Abgabezeitpunkt ist aktenkundig zu machen. Die Diplomarbeit soll gebunden sein und eine Einleitung enthalten. Sie mu? mit einer Erkl?rung des Kandidaten versehen sein, da? er die Arbeit selbst verfa?t und keine anderen als die angegebenen Quellen und Hilfsmittel benutzt hat. Wird die Diplomarbeit nicht fristgem?? abgeliefert, wird sie mit "nicht ausreichend" bewertet. Die Diplomarbeit verbleibt mit allen Unterlagen beim Pr?fungsamt. (8) Die Arbeit mu? von zwei Pr?fern beurteilt werden, es sei denn, da? ein zweiter Pr?fer nicht zur Verf?gung steht oder der Pr?fungsablauf durch die Bestellung eines zweiten Pr?fers unangemessen verz?gert w?rde. Erstgutachter soll derjenige sein, der das Thema der Arbeit gestellt hat. Wird die Diplomarbeit nur von einem Gutachter mit "nicht ausreichend" bewertet, so entscheidet der Pr?fungsausschu?, er kann einen weiteren Gutachter hinzuziehen. In allen anderen F?llen ergibt sich die Note aus dem arithmetischen Mittel der vergebenen Noten, gerundet zur n?chsten der nach ? 14 Abs.1 zul?ssigen Noten, im Grenzfall zugunsten des Kandidaten. (9) Die Diplomarbeit und die anderen Leistungen der Diplompr?fung werden getrennt benotet. ? 28 Zusatzf?cher (1) Auf Antrag kann der Pr?fungsausschu? dem Kandidaten gestatten, sich in weiteren als den vorgeschriebenen F?chern einer Pr?fung zu unterziehen (Zusatzf?cher). (2) Das Ergebnis der Pr?fung in diesen F?chern wird auf Antrag des Kandidaten in das Zeugnis aufgenommen, jedoch bei der Festsetzung der Gesamtnote nicht mit einbezogen. ? 29 Nichtbestehen der Diplompr?fung Die Pr?fung ist au?er in den F?llen des ? 4 Abs. 3 und ? 10 nicht bestanden, wenn die Bewertung der Diplomarbeit oder eine Fachnote "nicht ausreichend" lautet. ? 30 Wiederholung der Diplompr?fung (1) Ist die Diplompr?fung nicht bestanden oder ist ? 10 Abs. 1 anzuwenden, kann sie in den F?chern, die mit "nicht ausreichend" bewertet worden sind, wiederholt werden. Gilt die Diplompr?fung gem?? ? 4 Abs. 3 als nicht bestanden, ist sie insgesamt zu wiederholen. (2) Wird die Diplomarbeit mit "nicht ausreichend" bewertet, so ist auf Antrag, der sp?testens vier Wochen nach der Bekanntgabe der Note f?r die Diplomarbeit zu stellen ist, eine Wiederholung mit neuem Thema m?glich. Eine zweite Wiederholung ist ausgeschlossen. Im ?brigen gilt ? 27 entsprechend. (3) Die Abs?tze 2 bis 5 des ? 22 gelten entsprechend f?r die Wiederholung der Diplompr?fung. (4) Eine Wiederholung der Pr?fungen in Zusatzf?chern ist ausgeschlossen. ? 31 Freier Pr?fungsversuch (1) Wird die Diplompr?fung nach ununterbrochenem Studium der Mathematik innerhalb der gem?? ? 3 Abs. 1 bestimmten Regelstudienzeit von neun Fachsemestern erstmals vollst?ndig abgelegt und nicht bestanden, so gilt die Pr?fung au?er in den F?llen des Nichtbestehens nach ? 10 Abs. 4 als nicht abgelegt. Nach der Pr?fungsordnung anerkannte Studienzeiten bei Hochschul-, Studiengangs- oder Fachwechsel werden auf das Fachstudium angerechnet. (2) Im Rahmen des freien Pr?fungsversuchs bestandene Fachpr?fungen werden angerechnet, wenn die Meldung zur erneuten Ablegung innerhalb von drei Wochen nach Mitteilung ?ber das Nichtbestehen erfolgt und die vollst?ndige Ablegung sp?testens zum n?chsten regul?ren Pr?fungstermin oder, sofern ein solcher nicht festgelegt ist, innerhalb von drei Monaten nach dem letzten Teil des freien Pr?fungsversuchs abgeschlossen wird. Die Fachpr?fung kann zur Notenverbesserung einmal wiederholt werden, wobei das jeweils bessere Ergebnis z?hlt. Absatz 1 und Absatz 2 S?tze 1 und 2 gelten nicht f?r die Diplomarbeit. ? 32 Zeugnis und Diplom (1) ?ber die bestandene Diplompr?fung sind ein Zeugnis und ein Diplom auszustellen. Hierbei soll eine Frist von vier Wochen eingehalten werden. (2) Das Zeugnis enth?lt die Noten der einzelnen Pr?fungsf?cher, die Namen der Pr?fer, das Thema und die Note der Diplomarbeit mit Angabe des Aufgabenstellers und des Zweitgutachters, ferner die Pr?fungsgesamtnote. (3) Das Zeugnis ist vom Vorsitzenden des Pr?fungsausschusses zu unterzeichnen. Als Datum des Zeugnisses ist der Tag anzugeben, an dem alle Pr?fungsleistungen erbracht sind. Die Diplomurkunde wird vom Vorsitzenden des Pr?fungsausschusses unterzeichnet und mit dem Siegel der Fakult?t versehen.
