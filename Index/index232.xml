Orientation Programme Organizing Your Studies Life in Regensburg FAQ Download Contact Change of Degree Programme or University According to regulations, if you are in Germany to study, you are not entitled to a residence permit for a different reason, unless you have a legal claim (e.g. through marriage to a German citizen). A new residence permit can only be issued if you leave the country and then return. The reason for residence is determined by field of study. In your residence permit, the purpose of study is indicated by your degree programme and, if appropriate, field of study. If you change fields during your studies, this means that your reason for residence has changed, which, in turn, generally means that the residence permit you were issued is automatically rendered invalid. As a rule, it is however possible to change your degree (e.g. from German to Spanish) or to change subjects within the same course (e.g. swapping French for Italian as part of your degree in Romance languages) as long as this happens in the first 18 months after beginning your studies. If you change your field or degree course later, university regulations apply. If university regulations allow the change, it can also be approved according to the legal regulations for foreigners as long as the work you have done so far can be credited so that the total time needed to complete your studies is not extended for more than 18 months (university confirmation). Whatever the situation, you must register any change with the Municipal Immigration Office so that the change in your reason for residence can be recorded. If these prerequisites do not apply or if you wish to change subjects or degree programme again, this is only permissible if your studies can be completed within a total of ten years. The same regulations apply if you change to a different type of higher educational establishment (e.g. you continue in your field but change from a university to a technical college). The following do not constitute a change of field, but an - insignificant - change in concentration within your studies: the relevant study regulations show that both degree programmes were identical until the point where you changed, or that the semesters you spent on the old programme may count towards the programme you wish to change to. you have written confirmation from the appropriate department that the semesters you spent on the first programme may count to a great extent towards the other programme. for organisational reasons concerning your studies (e.g. enrollment is only possible in the Winter Semester), it is not possible for you to start your desired degree programme after completing your preparations for study, and so you use the spare semester to follow a different degree programme. Whatever the circumstances, you must always contact the Immigration Office to register the change in your residence permit. Any further qualification you may then embark on after completing your first degree programme, or any course which leads on from your first qualification in Germany (e.g. training to become a specialist after completing your medical degree) constitutes a change in your reason for residence. A change is generally not admissible if your total period of residence would then exceed ten years.

VISA IS NOT REQUIRED No visa is required for the following countries: EU Countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Israel, USA, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Brasil, San Marino, Honduras, El Salvador, Andorra. The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides information on visa requirements including a list of countries that are exempt from the requirement of an entry visa. VISA IS REQUIRED A student visa is required for students from the following countries: All non-EU Countries (with exception of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Israel, USA, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand) There are three different visa types that are applicable for you: Visa for student applicants Visa for preparatory study purposes Student visa After your arrival in Germany you have up to 3 months time to contact your Municipal Foreigners' Registration Office (Ausländerbehörde) to receive the appropriate residence permit. Depending on your entry visa, you may complete preparatory language courses or other preparatory study courses before your degree course begins: Visa for student applicants: This visa allows you to stay in Germany for preparatory purposes for up to 9 months (maximum!). If you have not received an official admission for a degree course, a preparatory language course at a university, or a "Studienkolleg", you will have to leave Germany. Visa for preparatory study purposes: With this entry visa you may stay in Germany for up to 2 years (maximum). Within these 2 years you may take preparatory language courses (max. 18 months duration) and, if necessary, pass the Studienkolleg or pass mandatory internships. After having stayed in Germany for 2 years, you may only stay in Germany if you have an admission to a degree course in Germany. Student visa:  This visa grants your residence permit for your degree course. Please do not enter Germany with a tourist visa as this visa cannot be changed into a residence permit for study purposes. The processing of a visa application can take up to two months. Make sure to contact the appropriate German embassy or consulate early! The notification of admission is the basis for receiving a student visa. Please apply for a date of entry no later than when you are to appear at the University according to the notification of admission (this is usually at the beginning of the training course for the DSH examination). Other documents may be required from the German Embassy along with the notification of admission, such as a financial verification and proof of health insurance. Please inquire directly at the proper embassy about which documents you must submit. EU-COUNTRIES People from EU countries including Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway can enjoy freedom of movement within the European Union. They do not need a visa, residence category or work permit. During the transitional period, citizens from states which entered the EU in 2007 (Bulgarien and Rumania) require an EU work permit from the employment exchange, which is issued or not according to the situation on the German job market. Photo: Rock Cohne (CC BY-SA 2.0) After arriving in Germany, EU citizens and citizens from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway are required to register at the Municipal Immigration Office within three months to provide information concerning their purpose of residence. The following documents are generally required: Registration and notification of residence according to § 5 Freedom of Movement Law / EU (Forms at Municipal Immigration Office or here) Passport or ID card Where appropriate, proof of family membership (e.g. marriage certificate, proof of ancestry) biometrical foto Additional documents are usually not necessary unless required by the Municipal Immigration Office. After you have registered, the Municipal Immigration Office will automatically send you certification of your right of residence. If you do not receive this, please contact the Municipal Immigration Office. If you already have an EU residence permit or certification of your right of residence and are moving to Regensburg from elsewhere in Germany, all you need to do is register with the Municipal Immigration Office in Regensburg. Fees: free of charge SWITZERLAND Swiss citizens can also move freely within the European Union and must register at the Municipal Immigration Office within three months of arrival in Germany. They do not require a visa or work permit, but they do need a residence category and must therefore apply. The following documents are generally required: Registration and application for issue of a residence category (Forms at Municipal Immigration Office or on the Internet) Passport or ID card Student enrolment Health insurance Proof of sufficient financial means to survive If you already have a residence category and are moving to Regensburg from elsewhere in Germany, all you need to do is register with the Municipal Immigration Office in Regensburg.

Orientation Programme Organizing Your Studies Life in Regensburg FAQ Download Contact Work and Study Before you start work, it is vital that you check whether the residence permit in your passport expressly allows this type of work. If this is not the case, you must apply to the Municipal Immigration Office for permission to accept the job. Financing your studies completely through student jobs is usually not possible, as job offers are limited. Participants of the preparatory language course Please note that you are only allowed to take on a holiday job while you are participating in the preparatory language course! Students from non-EU countries A residence permit for the purpose of studying allows students to take on (holiday) jobs which do not exceed 120 days or 240 half-days per year, or to take on student jobs. Half and whole days can be combined. Students may take on (holiday) jobs both during the semester and during the semester break. Working time only encompasses the days or half-days actually worked. You will be required to provide adequate documentation of your working hours. If you work half-days, you should base your working hours on the regular working hours of the other company employees. Half-days constitute no more than 4 hours a day if the the other employees regularly work an 8-hour day. The maximum number of hours constituting a half-day is five if the regular working day is 10 hours long. Students from Bulgaria and Rumania For students from Bulgaria and Rumania (having joined the EU 1.1.2007) the same rules as for students from non-EU countries apply for a transitional period of maximal 7 years. Students from EU countries Students from all other EU-countries except Rumania and Bulgaria are allowed to work like German students: during the semester they may work up to 20 hours per week, during the holidays they are allowed to work full-time. STUDENT JOBS Students may also take on student jobs with no time-limit at the university (e.g. student helpers) or at other academic establishments. Student jobs also encompass jobs involving university-related and study-related activities in organisations connected to the university (such as tutors in the halls of residence run by the Lower Bavaria/Oberpfalz Student Union). INTERNSHIPS Internships are permitted if they form an integral component of your degree course, or are necessary for you to be able to complete your degree. You are however required to apply to the Immigration Office for permission, and to provide approprate documentation from the university. The hours you work on an internship do not count towards the hours you are permitted to work in the case of a (holiday) job. PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT Long-term employment (e.g. for a whole year) can count as a part-time job if the purpose of residence (studying) remains unchanged, and if this does not hinder or postpone your studies. The permission to work does not mean that the purpose of residence can be changed before your studies have been completed. The same applies to other recommended or voluntary employment described as an internship. If you wish to take up employment, you must apply to the Immigration Office for permission. If the type of employment is generally permissible (e.g. mainly academic work as a research assistant), no application is necessary, but if this is not the case, the Immigration Office must contact the employment agency in order for permission to be granted. However, the employment agency will normally only grant permission if no priority employees are available and if wages follow tariff regulations and are in line with local levels. Further job options Further employment may also be allowed in exceptional cases if your means of subsistence can no longer be guaranteed due to circumstances beyond your control, or beyond that of your family members, and if you have so far conducted your studies conscientiously and the university can confirm that it is to be expected that you will finish your degree. Further exceptions can be made for citizens of Andorra, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, San Marino, and the USA. The regulations described above apply accordingly.

You need a valid passport for you and accompanying family members. Apply for a visa for you and your accompanying family members. Submit your visa application in good time as the processing of your application might take 6 ? 8 weeks. You can apply for a visa at the German Embassy in your home country or a German consulate representing the area in which you are registered or usually live. Some countries (e.g. the EU countries or the USA) are exempt from the entry visa regulations. For more information please check here. You need a confirmation of your health insurance coverage, if your coverage is also valid for your stay in Germany. If your health insurance in your home country will not cover you while you are abroad, you will have to obtain health insurance in Germany for the whole duration of your stay. IMPORTANT: You will need health insurance for yourself and your family in Germany. This is required for your residency permit. Please ask us for advice on which insurance to take as a lot of insurances from other countries are NOT accepted by the immigration authorities here in Germany. In case you have a liability insurance or a private accident insurance in your home country or any other insurances that might also be valid in Germany, please bring the appropriate documents with you. If you bring your spouse and children, you will need the marriage and birth certificates. Several passport-sized photos (biometric) from all family members. Proof of sufficient financial resources (employment contract, confirmation from your scholarship). Bring your invitation letter from your host. Certified translation in English or German of your school certificates (High School Diploma, GCF, etc.) of your university degrees and, if applicable, your doctoral degree. International vaccination certificate. If applicable, you may also want to bring documents about any medical conditions and required medication. International driver?s license if you intend to drive a car while you are in Germany. Please consider the climate in Regensburg when packing your clothes for the duration of your stay. Regensburg has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons. However, even in summer you have to be prepared for cold and rainy days. Electrical connections in Germany are 220 ? 240 Volt, 50 ? Hertz a/c mains with European standard plugs. Therefore, check whether you need adapters for any electrical devices you bring with you. These will be definitely easier to find in your home country than in Germany.

We have put together some basic information to get you started. The Welcome Center can help you search for an appropriate child care provider. Photo: Stefan Hanke Photografy Child care for children under 3 years old The city of Regensburg offers a good selection of child care providers for children under the age of three ("Krabbelstuben" or "Kindertagesstätte".) You need to take into consideration that most spots at a "Krabbelstube" will be either only for the morning or for the afternoon, and not for the whole day. Here you will find an Overview  (in German) of the "Krabbelstuben" in Regensburg. Child care for children between 3 and 6 years old Children between the ages of three and six (that is, until they start school) normally attend a "Kindergarten." The city of Regensburg has published a list of Kindergartens (in German.) Schools From six years on, children attend school. The primary school ("Grundschule") is the first common institution responsible for children's education. The "Grundschule" encompasses 1st grade to 4th grade. From 5th grade onwards, there are three types of secondary schools to choose from: the "Mittelschule" (in some places called "Hauptschule"), "Realschule" and "Gymnasium," depending on academic achievements and aptitude. These secondary schools each have different length periods: the "Mittelschule" goes through 9th grade, the "Realschule" goes through 10th grade and the "Gymnasium" goes through 12th grade. The city of Regensburg also provides an Overview(in German) of the different secondary schools according to school type. Here you will find more detailled information about the Bavarian school system (in German). International School The Swiss International School is a state-approved alternative private school. For  several years there were two international schools in Regensburg. They merged in April 2013. One School with two programs SIS offers two different academic programs: school education in English closely following the curriculum of the  International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) German-English school education following the curriculum of the Bavarian Abitur (secondary-school examination). Pupils attending the SIS can either pursue the Abitur or the worldwide recognized  International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma. The common pre-school is intended to follow the bilingual model. Since the merger of both schools is not quite completed, you may access here both websites: Swiss International School Regensburg und der Regensburg International School.

This is for example necessary to comply with the regulations regarding your residence permit, but also due to practical reasons: the German health care is relatively expensive. Regensburg has a very good network of general practitioners and medical specialists as well as hospitals. Right next to the UR campus is the University Hospital. However, there is no free-of-charge treatment or medical consultation for members or employees of the university. Why do I have to take out a health insurance? Regensburg does not have any free-of-charge medical institution for members of the university. In case you or your family members fall ill, you will need to go to a doctor in the city or at one of the hospitals. To be granted a residence permit, you will need to show proof of comprehensive health insurance for the whole period of stay in Germany. Where do I find a doctor? If you need to see a doctor during the day you should seek your general practitioner or family doctor. If you have not been to a doctor before in Regensburg, you will find a list in the telephone book or yellow pages under the letter A (for "Arzt"). The Regensburger Ärztenetz offers a search engine to find general practitioners and specialists including which languages they speak on its website. In case you need to see a doctor either at night, on public holidays or during the weekend, please call the telephone number of the Regensburg medical on-call service ("Ärztlicher Bereitschaftsdienst in Raum Regensburg"): 01805 - 19 12 12.  You may also call the German medical on-call service: 116 117 (valid both in Regensburg AND Germany-wide, free-of-charge). For emergencies (in the case that you cannot go on your own to a doctor), please call the emergency rescue service: 112. There is also a dentist on-call service ("Zahnärztlichen Notdienst im Universitätsklinikum"), for when ever you need to see a dentist either at night or on the weekend: (0941) 944-0. What documents do I have to take to the doctor? Which documents you need to take to the practitioner's office depends on your home country and which health insurance you have: People that are covered by a social security agreement, have to present their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). You will receive this card from the health insurance company (or social security) in your home country. PhD candidates and guest researchers who have German health insurance have to present the health insurance card from their health insurance company. In case you have private health insurance, you will need to take proof of your insurance to the doctor's office.

More detailled information about insurances can be found in the website of EURAXESS. Here you will find an overview of the different insurances: Accident insurance Everyone who is enrolled at the University of Regensburg or has a work contract with the UR is automatically covered by the statutory accident insurance if he/she has an accident at the work place or on the way to and from work. If you should have an accident, please notify either the Office of the Registrar (for enrolled PhD candidates) or the Human Ressources Department (for staff). You may also consider to take out a private accident insurance to cover accidents in other situations. Liability insurance Sometimes it may be the case that without intention someone may cause damages to someone else (for example, if you brake something in the flat you are renting). A liability insurance will reimburse the insured for these damages. Please take into account that many private landlords may require that you have liability insurance, to cover for potential damages to the flat. Household and personal possessions insurance Household insurance covers your home and all personal possessions against the risks of fire, flooding occurred due to breaking or leakage of the water pipes, storm, hail, burglary, robbery and vandalism. Apart from the actual costs of replacing the possessions, the insurance covers the extra costs involved, such as clean-up costs and hotel costs, among others. Usually the household insurance considers the replacement value, which means the actual cost of purchasing those items at current market prices.

The pension insurance is taken directly off your gross salary: generally the employer pays half of the contribution while the employee pays the other half. As this process is automatic, you (as the employee) do not have to do anything. The employer signs you up to the appropriate health insurance company, which in turn will proceed with signing you up to all other agencies within the social security.

You may find more information in English and in other languages under the following link: Deutschen Rentenversicherung. Reimbursement of social security contributions If you are going to return to a country that does not have a social security agreement with Germany, you may apply to get a reimbursement of the contributions made to the German statutory social security.

It is possible that part of the withheld taxes will get reimbursed to you. The necessary forms to file your income tax return can be picked up either at the local tax office or at the town hall (Rathaus). To be able to file your tax return, you will need a tax ID number  (Steueridentifikationsnummer (IdNr)). For more information about the purpose and use of the tax ID Number, please click here: Tax ID Number (in English). You can apply for this number here: Bundeszentralamt für Steuern (in German). NOTE that you can only apply for this ID number after you have registered at the Foreigners' Registration Office. There are different requirements which need to be taken into account to comply with your tax liability. Research period with a scholarship In case you are financing your research period in Germany with a scholarship, you may be, under certain circumstances, exempted from paying taxes here. We recommend that you clarify this with your scholarship provider. You will also need to find out whether you need to file an income tax return in your home country for the scholarship you received in Germany. Research period with a work contract If you are doing research and financing your stay in Germany with a work contract AND are residing here longer than 6 months, you will be taxed in Germany for the total of your worldwide earnings. If you stay for less than 6 months, your income will be taxed in your own country provided that you work for a foreign employer and the double taxation agreement assigns the right of taxation in such cases to the home country. If one of these conditions does not hold, your salary will be taxed in Germany. Agreements exist with some countries stating that higher education teachers and researchers who come to Germany for a maximum of two years to work on research in a public research institution may pay their taxes in their own country. The income tax you incur will be deducted from your salary at source. At the end of each calendar year you may apply to the tax office in your place of residence to have your income tax adjusted ("Lohnsteuerausgleich"). This may entitle you to a partial reimbursement of  tax paid. The necessary documents can be obtained from the local tax office ("Finanzamt") or town hall ("Rathaus"). Often, it is worth paying a tax accountant to help you complete your tax return. Details can be found on the EURAXESS website. Double taxation To avoid that foreigners are taxed both in Germany and in their home country for the same calendar year, double taxation agreements have been implemented. These agreements regulate in which country taxes have to be paid. The latest information about double taxation agreements can be found on the website of the German Federal Ministry of Finance (in German).  Church tax Characteristic of the German tax system is that the state also withholds church taxes. Certain religious communities have the option to request the fiscal authorities to collect church taxes in their behalf. Hence, the German state automatically withholds  from the employees' monthly income the church tax (9% of the income tax) together with the wage tax for those people who are registered as beeing affiliated with one of the big churches (Protestant, Roman Catholic or Jewish). That is why you are asked to fill in your religious affiliation when registering at the Foreigners' Registration Office. If you state that you are without a religious affiliation, no church taxes will be withheld.

It is possible that part of the withheld taxes will get reimbursed to you. The necessary forms to file your income tax return can be picked up either at the local tax office or at the town hall (Rathaus). To be able to file your tax return, you will need a tax ID number  (Steueridentifikationsnummer (IdNr)). For more information about the purpose and use of the tax ID Number, please click here: Tax ID Number (in English). You can apply for this number here: Bundeszentralamt für Steuern (in German). NOTE that you can only apply for this ID number after you have registered at the Foreigners' Registration Office. There are different requirements which need to be taken into account to comply with your tax liability. Research period with a scholarship In case you are financing your research period in Germany with a scholarship, you may be, under certain circumstances, exempted from paying taxes here. We recommend that you clarify this with your scholarship provider. You will also need to find out whether you need to file an income tax return in your home country for the scholarship you received in Germany. Research period with a work contract If you are doing research and financing your stay in Germany with a work contract AND are residing here longer than 6 months, you will be taxed in Germany for the total of your worldwide earnings. If you stay for less than 6 months, your income will be taxed in your own country provided that you work for a foreign employer and the double taxation agreement assigns the right of taxation in such cases to the home country. If one of these conditions does not hold, your salary will be taxed in Germany.

General Information Study Courses National Codex General Information THE CITY OF REGENSBURG AND ITS UNIVERSITY The attractiveness of the university is enhanced by the appeal of the city itself, with its ever-present traces of more than 2,000 years of history. Since July 2006, Regensburg carries the UNESCO distinction ?World Heritage?, which recognizes the unique character of the medieval city centre and its magnificent architecture - above all the Old Stone Bridge above the Danube and St. Peter?s Cathedral. Photo: Regensburg Tourismus GmbH In recent years Regensburg has witnessed a renaissance due partly to the founding of the university and its subsequent broadening of the academic community and partly to the settling of many modern industrial and technological ventures. Today Regensburg is experiencing an increase in prosperity, with one of the highest productivity rates in all of Germany and a steady growth in population. The University of Regensburg, founded in 1962, is located on a modern campus at the southern edge of a historic city dating back to the Middle Ages.
